# full_text_index_search_tool_python_capstone_project (based in inverted index)
This is a capstone project in python to develop entire full text index search tool to be capable of indexing several files based on inverted index and enable a quick textual search capability in all files' contents.

##########################
# Existing search capabilities-
##########################
# Create indexes (in-memory) for given files
# search for a word or a phrase in a file
# search in multiple files
# display search results- files that contain the word and frequency of occurrence in each file
# search results are sorted with most frequent occurrence on the top
# search case-insensitive
# search irrespective of the punctuations
# 
##########################
# Planned future enhancements-
##########################
# read files on physical disk and index them --> then search
# provide a path of files and search within all the files on that path
# develop UI to: give path of text files, enter phrase to search for, search results, open file from results
# store the files as well as indexes in DB
# check if the file is modified or new and only then index it
# run periodic indexation --> can be neglected
